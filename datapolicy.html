            <p><h1>Data Protection</h1></p>
            <p>Last updated: December 06, 2022</p>
            
            <p>This GST Personal Data Policy (“PD Policy”) sets out how AIA Singapore Private Limited (“GST”) and its associated individuals/organizations collect, use, disclose and retain your personal data.</p>
            
           <p> Among the most important assets of GST is the trust and confidence placed in us to properly handle personal data. You can expect us to maintain your personal data accurately, protect your personal data against manipulation and errors and keep your personal data secure from theft and free from unwarranted disclosure.</p>
            
            <P>This PD Policy provides you with notice as to what and how personal data is collected, how it is intended to be used, to whom your personal data may be transferred to, how to access, review and amend your personal data and our policy on the use of cookies.</P>

            <p>GST recognises its responsibilities in relation to the collection, holding, processing, use and disclosure of personal data. The provision of your personal data is voluntary. You may choose not to provide us with the requested data, but failure to do so may inhibit our ability to do business with or provide services to you.</p>

            <P>Save where “policy” is referred to in the context of the PD Policy, references to such expression may, in addition to insurance policies that you may have purchased or under which you may be covered, include GST programmes to which you have subscribed or in which you are participating.</P>

            <p><h1>How we collect personal data</h1></p>
           <p> GST collects personal data in the following ways:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>when you use our products or services, access our website and use our online and mobile services;</li>
                    <li>when you submit documents and application forms to us during the application process for the purchase, or in consideration of the purchase, of our products or services;</li>
                    <li>when you submit requests for changes or updates to your policy or any other requests in connection with your policy including through the submission of policy servicing forms and documents;</li>
                    <li>when you respond to our queries or request for us to contact you;</li>
                    <li>when you interact with our personnel, agents, customer service officers or sales representatives via phone, email, face to face meetings, interviews, SMS, fax, mail or electronic mail;</li>
                    <li>when we receive referrals and collect personal data from within AIA, its associated persons/organisations, agents, business partners and service providers (collectively “AIA Persons”), and third party service providers and representatives of AIA Persons;</li>
                    <li>when you submit personal data to us to participate in a lucky draw, contest, event or competition organised by AIA, its partners, representatives or service providers;</li>
                    <li>when we seek information from third parties about you including but not limited to investigators, medical sources, hospitals, doctors, other healthcare professionals in connection with your policy, policy applications, underwriting the risks of your policy, policy claims and/or products and services of AIA used or purchased by you (“Medical Sources”).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By providing us with any personal data relating to a third party (e.g. insured persons, family members, and beneficiaries), you represent and warrant that you shall ensure accuracy of such personal data provided and have obtained such third party’s prior consent for our collection, use and disclosure of such third party’s personal data for the relevant purposes, except to the extent that such consent is not required under relevant law. You further agree to keep us fully indemnified from and against any and all damages, losses, costs, legal fees (solicitor- client basis), penalties and proceedings, including any penalties or other amounts levied, imposed or charges by any regulator or regulatory authority, arising out of or in connection with your (or those of your officers, employees, advisors, agents and representatives) acts or omission, fault or negligence in performing these obligations or which results in us breaching relevant laws.</p>
                
                <p>If you make use of any social media features or platforms, either on our website, an application we provide, or otherwise through a social media provider, we may access and collect information about you via that social media provider in accordance with their policies. When using a social media feature, we may access and collect information you have chosen to make available and to include in your social media profile or account, including but not limited to your name, gender, birthday, email address, address, location etc. Our access to this information may be limited or blocked based on your privacy settings with the relevant social media provider.</p>

                <p>We will usually identify any information which is mandatory (i.e. information required for creating an account, and to enable you to access the features of the website and receive any services) when we collect the information from you. You may choose not to provide us with the requested data, but failure to do so may inhibit our ability to do business with you or to respond to your enquiries.</p>

            <h1>Consent for marketing purposes</h1>

                If you withdraw your consent for us to collect, use or disclose your personal data for non-marketing reasons, we will be unable to process, administer and/or manage your policy, relationship and/or account with us. In such event, you may be required to surrender or terminate all your policies or accounts or withdraw from any programs in which you are participating. This may be to your disadvantage, as you may be losing valuable benefits from your policies or programmes, incur surrender charges or it may not be possible for you to obtain a similar level of protection on the same terms in the future.</p>

                <p>You may withdraw your consent for your personal data to be used for marketing purposes and you will stop receiving marketing information from us via the mode(s) of communication for which you have withdrawn such consent after a period permitted under law or in accordance with our internal policies. Please note that such withdrawal of your consent will not affect our ability to provide you with the products and services for which you have requested or to which you have applied, subscribed or are participating with us.</p>

                <h1>Data accuracy</h1>

                <p>As GST relies on your personal data to provide products and services to you, you shall ensure that the information provided by you to us is at all times correct, accurate and complete. You shall update us in a timely manner of all changes to the information provided to us.</p>
